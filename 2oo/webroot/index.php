    <p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model organized 
      around objects rather than "actions" and data rather than logic.

    <h2>Principles of OOP (the tools at our disposal)</h2>
    
    <p>
      <b><a href="abstraction.php">Abstraction</a></b> - Let's define the concept of a widget rather than that specific (instance) of a widget.
     </p>
    
    <p>
      <b><a href="encapsulation.php">Encapsulation</a></b> - We're focusing on our domain objects their properties and actions
      properties
      <blockquote>
        getters | accessors - Tell me about yourself<br>
        setters | mutators - Modify state of object while hiding implementation
      </blockquote>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b><a href="inheritance.php">Inheritance</a></b> - We can reduce code and ensure consistency 
      <blockquote>Animal > Bird | Fish | Feline > Cat | Lion | Tiger</blockquote>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <b><a href="polymorphism.php">Polymorphism</a></b>  - Sometimes we need to change the logic or provide more that one way to ask the same question (method signature). 
    
      Merriam-Webster: the quality or state of existing in or assuming different forms
      (one name, many forms)
      <blockquote>
        Overriding - Inheritance<br>
        Overloading - Ask the same question with different inputs
      </blockquote>
